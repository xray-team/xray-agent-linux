	// WeightedTimeSpentDoingIOs - total wait time for all requests. This field is incremented at each I/O start, I/O completion, I/O merge, or read of these stats by the number of I/Os in progress
	// (IOsCurrentlyInProgress) times the number of milliseconds spent doing I/O since the last update of this field.  This can provide an easy measure of both
